# Python-GUI-Calculator
📌 Overview

This project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) calculator built using Python and Tkinter.
It is designed to help beginners understand event-driven programming, GUI layouts, and clean Python coding practices.

The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations through an interactive window instead of a command-line interface.

✨ Features

- User-friendly graphical interface

- Basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition

- Subtraction

- Multiplication

- Division

- Error handling for invalid input

- Clear/reset functionality

- Responsive button-based input

🛠 Technologies Used

- Language: Python

- GUI Library: Tkinter (built-in Python module)
